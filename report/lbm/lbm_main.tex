\chapter{The lattice-Boltzmann method}
short intro of this section

\section{Historical overview}
A few words on the history of the method. Lattice automata etc.

\section{Maybe something on asymptotic analysis}
Some theory that could be useful in the chapman-enskog derivations.

\section{Basic idea}
The principle behind the method, what it does and does not.

\section{Collision operator}
discussions on different col. operators, focus on BGK since that is
the one used.

\section{Streaming}
maybe not so much to say here

\section{Boundary conditions}
discussion and description of the boundary conditions
\subsection{bounce back}
accuracy, e.g. second order accurate if placed between node planes...
\subsection{slip}
\subsection{he-zou, constant density/velocity}
\subsection{Maybe something on non-local boundary conditions}

\section{Forcing schemes}
how to add a ''forcing'' term in the method.

\section{LBM for Navier-Stokes}
\subsection{Chapman-Enskog}

\section{LBM for Poisson's equation}
\subsection{Chapman-Enskog}

\section{LBM for Nernst-Planck}
\subsection{Chapman-Enskog}

\section{Algorithm/Scheme for solving the coupled equations}
the iterative scheme used.

\section{Physical units vs lattice units}
how to interchange between them... etc...
