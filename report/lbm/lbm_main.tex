\chapter{The lattice-Boltzmann method}\label{sec:lbm}
Rather than modelling on a macroscopic or microscopic scale, the
lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) operates at a scale in between those,
often referred to as a mesoscopic scale. Nowadays, the method is most
frequently used in modelling of fluid dynamics, i.e. computing
solutions of the macroscopic Navier-Stokes equations. However, the
lattice-Boltzmann method is not limited to this case and may be used
to model other macroscopic systems as well. In this chapter a LBM
approach will, in addition to the Navier-Stokes equations, also be
formulated for the Nernst-Planck and Poission's equation.
