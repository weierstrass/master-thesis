\chapter{The lattice-Boltzmann method}
Rather than modelling on a macroscopic or microscopic scale, the
lattice-Boltzmann method operates at a scale in between those, often
referred to as a mesoscopic scale. Nowadays, the method is most
frequently used in modelling fluid dynamics, i.e. solving the
macroscopic Navier-Stokes equations. However, the lattice-Boltzmann
method is not limited to this case and may be used to model other
macroscopic systems as well. In this chapter a LBM approach will, in
addition to the Navier-Stokes equations, also be formulated for the
Nernst-Planck and the Poission's equation.

\section{Historical overview}
With the introduction of electronic calculating machines came also a
completely new possibility of tackling problems. New fields of
computational science was born and methods for solving both new and
traditional problems were developed.

The idea of using a discrete and simplified version of the
Boltzmann-equation dates back to the mid 60's \cite{scholarpedia-lbm}
with an experimental attempt to model simple gas dynamics. However, at
the time, this kind of statistical computational approaches was not
considered a serious alternative for the modelling of more
sophisticated and complex systems such as fluid behaviour. It was
first in the mid 80's when Frisch, Hasslacher and Pomeau showed that a
lattice automaton, with a lattice of certain symmetry and that
conserved mass and momentum in the collisions, reproduced the
Navier-Stokes equations in a macroscopic limit. It was by their work
and the always increasing computational power that made the idea of
fluid modelling on a mesoscopic scale a serious research
topic. \cite{wolf-gladrow}

But the lattice gas automata (LGA) approach suffered from some flaws,
e.g. that the boolean nature of the method introduced statistical
noise and that lack of symmetry in the lattices used made the advection
non-isotropic. The statistical noise was usually dealt with by
averaging which resulted in a coarsed domain and the advection issue
was handled by introducing lattices of higher symmetry. As the flaws
of the LGA approach was dealt with one after one, the method evolved
into what we today know as the lattice-Boltzmann method, with the
crucial refinement of using continuous distributions over boolean
variables. \cite{wolf-gladrow} 

Today, the lattice-Boltzmann method is in many situations indeed a
competitor to more traditional CFD methods. For example with
advantages when it comes to parallelisation or implementing boundary
conditions in complex geometries. The downside with the LBM is the
lack of theoretical work done and lack of literature compared to the
case with traditional methods such as finite element/volume
methods. \cite{junk-asym}
