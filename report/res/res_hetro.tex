\section{Flow in a channel with heterogeneously charged walls}

Now a channel with walls charged with a varying charge is
considered. The walls are charged piecewise constant with every second
piece positive and negative respectively, see
fig. \ref{fig:res:h_setup}. The length of the charged sections are
chosen as $d/4$ where $d = 10 \mu$m is the width of the channel. The
flow is electroosmotic and driven by an external field of $50$ kV/m.

The resulting velocity profile together with the charge distribution
of positive ions in the steady state is presented in
fig. \ref{fig:res:hetro}.

There is an accumulation of positive and negative ions in the vicinity
of the negative and positive charged boundaries respectively. In the
middle of the channel, the fluid is neutral.

The vortexes obtained agrees qualitatively with those computed in
\cite{lbm-wang}. This kind of system is for example used in mixing of
charge fluids \cite{mixing}. Varying charges are imposed on the
boundary of a domain and an electric field is applied, this results
typically in a flow similar to the vortexes obtained here.
