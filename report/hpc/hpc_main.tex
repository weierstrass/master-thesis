\chapter{High performance computing and the LBM}\label{sec:hpc}
To benefit as much as possible from a numerical method, it is crucial
that it is implemented in an efficient manner. In this chapter, some
important aspects of this is discussed. In order to write a code that
allows for efficient execution, some principles behind how a computer
operates must be considered in detail. This varies considerable
between various computer architectures. In this chapter, the
discussion is limited to computers that implement the x86(-64)
architecture which is a very common alternative among today's
workstations.
