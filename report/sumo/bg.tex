\begin{itemize*}
%\item Electrokinetic systems - present in .
\item Example of applications: drugs, biological chips, fuel cells...
\item A lattice-Boltzmann code is developed at Chalmers to deal with
  transport/flow through complicated structures.
\item This work aims to investigate how electric effects may be integrated.
