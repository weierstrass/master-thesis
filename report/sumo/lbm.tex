\section{The lattice-Boltzmann method}

\subsection{A brief introduction}

\begin{frame}{A few words about the LBM}

\begin{itemize*}

\item Unconventional method to solve PDEs

\item Strengths: complex boundaries, straight-forward implementation,
  highly prallelisable algorithm

\item Weaknesses: New method $\implies$ lack of theoretical work,
  uniform lattice required also Kn $\ll 1$, 


\end{itemize*}
