\section{The velocity field - Navier-Stokes equations}
In hydrodynamics, the Navier-Stokes equations are one of the most
fundamental corner stones. They describe the motion of a fluid under
the influence of various internal and external forces. 

For later convenience and for reference when it comes to deriving the
Lattice-Boltzmann formulation of the NS equation, a brief sketch of a
derivation will here be presented. A most general form of the
Navier-Stokes equation follows from momentum conservation

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial (\rhorm \ubf)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \ubf
\otimes \ubf) + \Q = 0 
\end{equation}
where, $\rhorm$ is fluid density, $\ubf$ is velocity and $\Q$ is a
momentum source term (force per volume). Expanding the time
derivative and the divergence terms respectively gives
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:et:nspre}
\ubf \left ( \dfrac{\partial \rhorm}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot
  \rhorm \right ) + \rhorm \left (\dfrac{\partial \ubf}{\partial t} +
  \ubf \cdot \nabla \ubf 
  \right ) + \Q = 0.
\end{equation}
By assuring mass conservation (without sources) we have that

\begin{equation}\label{eq:et:mass_conc}
 \dfrac{\partial \rhorm}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot
  \rhorm = 0
\end{equation}
and eq. \eqref{eq:et:nspre} reduces to

\begin{equation}\label{eq:et:ns_general} 
\rhorm \left (\dfrac{\partial \ubf}{\partial t} +
  \ubf \cdot \nabla \ubf 
  \right ) + \Q = 0.
\end{equation}
which together with eq. \eqref{eq:et:mass_conc} is a general
formulation of the Navier stokes equations. 

The force term $\Q$, is determined by the physical properties of the
fluid and from its environment. In this work, only incompressible
Newtonian fluids will be studied. The force contribution to $\Q$
involved in that case is limited to viscous forces, pressure gradients
in the fluid and to external force fields. Putting that into
eqs. \eqref{eq:et:mass_conc} and \eqref{eq:et:ns_general} gives

\begin{equation}\label{eq:et:ns_incompressible}
 \nabla \cdot \rhorm = 0
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}\label{eq:et:ns_mom}
\rhorm \left (\dfrac{\partial \ubf}{\partial t} +
  \ubf \cdot \nabla \ubf 
  \right ) = - \nabla \Prm  + \mu \nabla^2 \ubf + \F
\end{equation}
where $\Prm$ is the pressure, $\mu$ the kinematic viscosity and $\F$
are the contributions from  external forces.
