\section{Complete physical model}\label{sec:et:coupling}
To model the fluid motion of a charged fluid under influences of
electrostatic forces, a coupling between different models is
considered.

The electric field and potential in the system are obtained from
solving Poisson's equation for electrostatics (section
\ref{sec:et:poisson}) with a given charge density. This Charge density
is obtained from the Nernst-Planck equation (section
\ref{sec:et:np}) by including effects on
the charge distribution from the electric field previously mentioned,
diffusion and advection. The advective charge flux is given from the
velocity field in the fluid that is obtatined by solving the
Navier-Stokes equations (section
\ref{sec:et:ns}). Forces due to present electric fields on net
charged areas of the fluid also couples the NS equations to the NP
equation. More about the force coupling is discussed in
sections. \ref{sec:et:streaming_pot} and
\ref{sec:et:electroosmosis}. The coupling between the different
equations are visualised in fig. \ref{fig:coupling}.
