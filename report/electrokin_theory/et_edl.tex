\section{Electrical double layers}
Consider an electrically neutral liquid, i.e. a liquid containing the
same amount of positive and negative ions. When this liquid is
introduced to, for example, a negatively charged surface, this even
charge distribution is disturbed in an area close to the surface. Due
to the introduced electrostatic forces, positive ions will be
attracted to the surface leaving a positive net charge in the vicinity
of the surface. It is possible to divide this positively charged
region in the liquid into two different layers. In the direct vicinity
of the surface, positive ions will adsorb onto the surface making them
less mobile than the others in the positively net charged area closer
to the bulk liquid. The two layers are often referred to as the Stern
layer (adsorbed) and the diffusive layer (mobile). This is also
illustrated in fig. \ref{fig:edl_charge} \cite{ren_book}

%potential charge general
The interface between the Stern and the diffusive layer is often
called the shear plane. Due to the difficulty of measuring the
potential at the true surface, i.e. the one in contact with the Stern
layer of the liquid, most models in the field of electrokinetics use
the shear plane as the boundary for which it exists accurate methods
to measure the potential \cite{ren_book}. The potential at the shear
plane will, from heron, be referred to as the $\zeta$-potential.

To be able to model the flow dynamics of liquids in a channel with
present EDLs, the potential and charge distribution in the channel
must be determined. These quantities are mutually related through
Poisson's equation for electrostatics:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pb}
\nabla^2\psi = -\frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_r \epsilon_0}
\end{equation}

where $\psi$ is the electrical potential, $\rho_e$ the electrical
charge density, $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity and
$\epsilon_0$ the vacuum permittivity. Under certain assumptions, the
charge density may be explicitly determined as a function of the
potential distribution, one such result is the so called
Poisson-Boltzmann equation.
