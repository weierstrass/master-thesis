\section{Physical and lattice units}

A physical system may in its physical units contain quantities which
numerical values may differ a lot from each other. It is therefore
typically a very bad idea and in the case with lattice-Boltzmann it
will in general not work to just solve the equation in physical
units. The equation is therefore scaled to dimensionless form by
introducing characteristic quantities. For example a quantity A is
scaled by A$_0$ to a dimensionless quantity A' through

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{A}' = \mathrm{A}/\mathrm{A_0} 
\end{equation}
